## Thresholds

| Target | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| CLAUDE.md | <5000 chars |
| Code examples in CLAUDE.md | ≤10 |
| Rules | ≤200 chars each |
| Skill definitions | ≤2000 chars |
| File length | ≤500 lines |
| Function length | ≤50 lines |
| Nesting depth | ≤5 levels |
| JSDoc comments | ≤15 lines |
| Commented-out code | ≤5 lines total |

## Detect

### CLAUDE.md
- Exceeds char limit
- Excessive code examples
- Duplicate/repetitive sections
- Verbose command docs (should reference package.json)
- Large ASCII diagrams
- Multi-step workflows (should be skills)

### Rules
- Verbose rules >200 chars
- Duplicate/similar rules
- Example-heavy rule files

### Skills
- Missing skills for common workflows
- Step-by-step procedures in CLAUDE.md (should be skills)
- Verbose skill definitions

### Code
- Long files (>500 lines)
- Long functions (>50 lines)
- Deep nesting (>5 levels)
- Duplicate code blocks

### Documentation
- Verbose JSDoc (>15 lines)
- Tutorial comments in source (belong in docs/)
- Commented-out code

## LLM-Native Validation

CLAUDE.md, rules, and skills must follow LLM-native patterns. Flag violations:

### Anti-patterns (flag these)
- Role preambles: "You are a...", "Act as...", "As an expert..."
- Conversational filler: "Please note that...", "It's important to...", "Remember to..."
- Redundant context: Repeating same information in different words
- Hedging language: "You might want to...", "Consider...", "Perhaps..."
- Verbose explanations before instructions
- Nested bullet hierarchies >2 levels deep
- Paragraph-form instructions (should be lists)
- Examples without clear pattern (>3 examples for same concept)

### Required patterns (flag if missing)
- Direct imperatives: "Use X", "Flag Y", "Return Z"
- Structured output schemas at top of prompts
- Lookup tables for mappings (status codes, severity levels)
- Flat list structures
- Terse detection patterns

### Severity mapping
- error: Role preambles, verbose explanations before action items
- warning: Conversational filler, redundant context, deep nesting
- suggestion: Minor verbosity, could be more terse

## Ignore

Code correctness, security, logic (handled by other agents)
